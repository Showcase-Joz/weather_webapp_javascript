A javascript ,Jquery, HTML and CSS app built with some material design lite elements that uses ip-api for location  which in turn feeds the lat and long information into OpenWeatherMaps API. The returned icon code is returned from
OpenWeatherMaps and matched to the the correct OwFont Weather Icon from the Owfont kit. Simple logic added to show only the
daytime icon set from 6am to 7pm depending on what is returned from Javascript Date object.
