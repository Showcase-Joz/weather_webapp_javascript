#WeatherBuddy 

See a Demo Here: http://www.ispeakcomputer.com/weatherbuddy/

additional demo for standard APIXU icon here: https://weather_webapp_javascript-joz681374.codeanyapp.com/index-default-icons.html

A webapp built to display the current weather in your area.
This webapp was built in a way that the browser doesn't need your permission to send location information. It instead uses freegeoip.net to get 
your latitude and longitude settings for the current public IP you are using. It takes this information and feeds it into the apixu.com current weather API.
After this is done the data is paired with a OwFont Weather Icon from the Owfont kit. Simple code to tell the app to use Night/Day icons (and variable ) depending on 
the time of day. 

#Motivation

This app was built in order has a quick way to always know the weather. It was built in a way that it could be used with a smart mirror project.
